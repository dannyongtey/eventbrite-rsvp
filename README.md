# EVENTBRITE RSVP EXTENSION

# Development for this extension will continue after I'm done with my latest project :)


* This application is originally developed for IT Society as many of our events are FOC and the sign-ups on Eventbrite often doesn't reflect the actual number of attendees that'll come.

* Not yet ready for release as some functionalities are incomplete. 

If you'd like to use however, here are the steps:

1. Save into the environment variables eventbrite_oauth, access_password (for login)
2. Change the email in application emailer file to your own email
